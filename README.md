# Dream Home

## this is my graduation project from HackerU College.

This web application is built on mongoDb + nodeJs +
react + redux
A real estate app where anyone who signs up can add
His house and thus publish them with pictures of
The place, phone number of the owner of the place,
exact details of the property And the price. That way,
anyone who logs into the app can Impress and decide
whether to contact in order to buy / rent
